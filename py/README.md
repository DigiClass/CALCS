particular languages from Pleiades, Wikidata, Geonames, and other sources, currently include:

###Python

 * ***adds-wiki.py*** - a script to browse a named list of Wikipedia categories (cats.txt) and create a list of all wiki pages included in that category (except those named "List of...") as wikipgs.txt 

###Text

 * ***cats.txt*** - a list of Wikipedia category URLs, hand created as likely to contain lists of named ancient sites
 * ***wikipgs.txt*** - a list of Wikipedia pages (generated by adds-wiki.py) relating to ancient sites
