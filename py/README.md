# CALCS - Python directory

The files in this directory, which will involve identification, extraction, matching and noting of names in
particular languages from Pleiades, Wikidata, Geonames, and other sources, currently include:

###Python

 * **adds-wiki.py** - a script to browse a named list of Wikipedia categories (cats.txt) and create a list of all wiki pages included in that category (except those named "List of...") as wikipgs.txt
 * **pleiad-wp-source.py** - script that scrapes the Pleiades JSON dump (not included here) and creates wpevid.json, by pulling out all places that cite WP pages as "seeFurther"
 * **pleiad-wdata.py** - script that pulls WP urls from wpevid.json, goes to the web page (at 1 second intervals) and finds the corresponding Wikidata URI, if there is one, to create pl-wp-wd.json

###Json

 * **denia.json** - sample json for one page from Wikidata, just to test against locally
 * **dianium.json** - sample json for four places from Pleiades, to test against locally
 * **wpevid.json** - json listing all the Pleiades places that cite Wikipedia pages as "seeFurther" (generated by pleiad-wp-source.py)
 * **pl-wp-wd.json** - json listing all Pleiades places with Wikipedia pages *and* corresponding Wikidata URIs (generated from wpevid.json by pleiad-wdata.py)

###Text

 * **cats.txt** - a list of Wikipedia category URLs, hand created as likely to contain lists of named ancient sites
 * **wikipgs.txt** - a list of Wikipedia pages (generated by adds-wiki.py) relating to ancient sites
 * **Pleiad-errors.txt** - a list of weird or broken Wikipedia links found in Pleiades json (not definitive)
